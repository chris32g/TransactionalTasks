This sample demonstrates transactional tasks based on the multitenancy example (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/ndb/transactions#python_Transactional_task_enqueuing).

For test purpose only

Hit many times the /taskqueue endpoint and see if the counter increases as expected.

Refer to the [App Engine Samples README](../README.md) for information on how to run and deploy this sample.
